Option 1: Switch Back to GUI Temporarily
If you're in TTY mode (Ctrl + Alt + F2, for example), you can switch back to the GUI (where the graphical server is running) by pressing Ctrl + Alt + F1 (or Ctrl + Alt + F7 depending on your system).

Once you're back in the GUI, you can open applications like Firefox, VS Code, or ChatGPT through the browser.
Option 2: Start GUI Applications from the CLI in a Running GUI Session
If your system is in CLI-only mode (no GUI running), but you want to run a GUI application:

Start the graphical server manually:

bash
Copy code
startx
This command will start an X session, allowing GUI applications to run.

Alternatively, if you want to switch back to a graphical environment but retain CLI functionality, you can switch to the graphical.target:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
sudo systemctl start graphical.target
Option 3: Use Remote X Server (Advanced)
You can run GUI applications over an SSH connection with X forwarding. For example, if you want to open a Firefox browser remotely on another machine or in an environment without a graphical server:

First, install the X server if not installed:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt install xorg
Then, start the application with X forwarding (if over SSH):
bash
Copy code
ssh -X user@remote-server
firefox
This method lets you run graphical applications over the network, but you still need some kind of graphical environment (even if remote).

3. Alternative CLI-Based Tools:
If you want to use the CLI for tasks usually done with GUI tools, there are alternatives:

Text Browsers: You can use text-based browsers like lynx or w3m to browse the web from the CLI:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install lynx
lynx example.com
CLI Text Editors: Use editors like vim or nano instead of VS Code.

ChatGPT CLI Client: You can interact with ChatGPT via a CLI client, but this would require an API key and installation of a tool such as openai-cli. Unfortunately, it won't work in full offline CLI mode without internet access.
