ls - list the files
su - switch user 
-l - list in detail
 for eg ls -l => will give list in detailed
wild card characters
* - used to give name related files
 for eg ls -l Do* => give the list of file that starts with Do
? - when you have similar file name 
 for eg ls -l co?e => shows file like code core cole etc..
mkdir - make directory
touch - create file
cp - copy

pavin@pavin-OMEN-by-HP-Gaming-Laptop-16-xd0xxx:~$ touch chumma/file1.txt chumma/file2.txt chumma/file3.txt
pavin@pavin-OMEN-by-HP-Gaming-Laptop-16-xd0xxx:~$ ls chumma
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt
pavin@pavin-OMEN-by-HP-Gaming-Laptop-16-xd0xxx:~$ cp chumma/file?.txt Documents/
pavin@pavin-OMEN-by-HP-Gaming-Laptop-16-xd0xxx:~$ ls Documents
 file1.txt   file2.txt   file3.txt  'PT-1 Abstract.docx'

rm - remove 
 rm filename  rm -r foldername
 
r - recursive (first delete the file and then folder)
rmdir - delete empty directories
echo - used to write content in terminal
 Eg => echo "This is the content" > Documents/example.txt
 
cat - write the content in terminal 
 Eg => cat Documents/example.txt  (This displays the content from the file)
 
Link is one of the crucial factor in linux cmds (ln)
symbolic link - not an exact copy but a typical redirection
	ln - s ~/Documents/example.txt ~/Desktop/example_symlink.txt
	To create link for existing we can use sf(sym link force) instead of s
Hardlink - Direct copy with Inode of data 
	ln ~/Documents/example.txt ~/Desktop/example_symlink.txt
	(even if delete the original the file be still available)

mv - Rename the file
	mv oldname newname
-i - interactive (ask for confirmation)

Types of way to view content
cat 
more - can be used with down arrow
less - can be used with arrow keys 
head - only gives first 10 lines
	we can also alter it by head -n 2 filename (this shows first 2 lines of the content)
tail - similar but comes from last
nl - numbered lines
vi - editor within terminal 

to exit from view press q 
to exit from editor press :q

find - used to find particular file from folder
	pavin@pavin-OMEN-by-HP-Gaming-Laptop-16-xd0xxx:~$ find ~/ -name "new_example.txt"
	/home/pavin/Documents/new_example.txt
	
	It can be found using name, extension(*.txt), directory(-type d folder_name), file(-type f file_name),modified_date(-mtime -1){shows files modified within 1 day} (-mtime +1){shows files modified before 1 day}
	
	pavin@pavin-OMEN-by-HP-Gaming-Laptop-16-xd0xxx:~$ cat Documents/new_example.txt 
	pavin@pavin-OMEN-by-HP-Gaming-Laptop-16-xd0xxx:~$ find ~ -type f -exec grep "Soldiers" {} \;
	Hi Soldiers
	 
	grep: /home/pavin/.cache/tracker3/files/http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.api.gnome.org%2Fontology%2Fv3%2Ftracker%23Documents.db-wal: binary file matches
	grep: /home/pavin/.config/microsoft-edge/Default/IndexedDB/https_coinmarketcap.com_0.indexeddb.blob/2/00/3: binary file matches
	echo "Hi Soldiers" > Documents/new_example.txt 
	pavin@pavin-OMEN-by-HP-Gaming-Laptop-16-xd0xxx:~$ 
	pavin@pavin-OMEN-by-HP-Gaming-Laptop-16-xd0xxx:~$ find ~ -type f -exec grep -l "Soldiers" {} \;
	/home/pavin/Documents/new_example.txt
	/home/pavin/.cache/tracker3/files/http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.api.gnome.org%2Fontology%2Fv3%2Ftracker%23Documents.db-wal
	/home/pavin/.config/microsoft-edge/Default/IndexedDB/https_coinmarketcap.com_0.indexeddb.blob/2/00/3
	/home/pavin/.bash_history

	
locate - used to find the file faster than find where all data stored in db ( initially we will do it by installing locate (sudo apt install locate) then sudo updatedb

which - shows from where the command is working (shows binary file)
whereis - shows both binary and help file
man - used to show help for particular command
-exec - used to execute some other command within a command

chmod - used to modify the permission of the file (read, write, execute) for (user, group, others)
	r - read		u - user
	w - write 		g - group
	x - execute		o - others
thor - pass: type@123

su - switch user 

To create new user: sudo useradd thor -m
In order to create a password: sudo passwd thor
To give bash access: su - thor

To create a group: sudo groupadd groupname
To add the user in that group: sudo usermod -aG groupname thor (-a > means we are going add user, G to remain the user in other groups)
to see the users group: groups thor

Example: To give rx to other users
	sudo chmod o+rx /home
chown - to give access to others or group
	sudo chown :soldiers Documents/new_example.txt 
here we are removing access: sudo chmod g-rwx Documents/new_example.txt 

File ownership:
	su root 
	touch adminfile (Owner: root)
	chown pavin adminfile (ownership changed from root to pavin)
	
	For Group we will mention with (:)
	chown :groupname adminfile
	
File compression:
	c - create new archive 
	z - archive using certain program (gzip)
	v - used to make list of files/directories being compressed
	f - filename for compression
	
	For Example,
		tar -czvf avengers_compressed.tar.gz avengers/  => This is how to compress a particular folder
		avengers/			}	
		avengers/thor.txt 		} Use of v in czvf

	zip -r avengers_compressed.zip avengers => using zip
	gzip avengers/thor.txt => using gzip to compress a file
	
File extraction:
	x - extract the archive
	z, v, f 
	
	For Example,
		tar -xzvf avengers_compressed.tar.gz  -C ~/Desktop/ => C is used to extract the directory in specific folder
		avengers/
		avengers/thor.txt
	
	unzip avengers_compressed.zip -d ~/Desktop/ => using zip and d used to extract in specific directory
	gunzip thor.txt.gz => Unzip the file

Environment Variable:
	
	To get Env of paritcular thing:
	pavin@pavin-OMEN-by-HP-Gaming-Laptop-16-xd0xxx:~$ printenv HOME
	/home/pavin
	pavin@pavin-OMEN-by-HP-Gaming-Laptop-16-xd0xxx:~$ echo $HOME
	/home/pavin

To boot system only with CLI : sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target and sudo reboot to restart
To get back to GUI : sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target

How to run c program:

for eg: bankers.c
gcc bankers.c -o bankers
./bankers
